# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature expands the timestamp converter application's API capabilities with advanced functionality including batch conversion optimization, timezone conversion support, performance enhancements, and robust caching mechanisms. The enhancement aims to provide a more scalable, efficient, and feature-rich API that can handle complex timestamp conversion scenarios while maintaining high performance and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to perform batch timestamp conversions efficiently, so that I can process multiple timestamps in a single request without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a batch conversion request with multiple timestamps THEN the system SHALL process all timestamps in a single API call
2. WHEN the batch size exceeds 100 timestamps THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the maximum batch size limit
3. WHEN batch conversion is requested THEN the system SHALL return results in the same order as the input timestamps
4. WHEN batch conversion encounters an invalid timestamp THEN the system SHALL continue processing other timestamps and mark the invalid one with an error status
5. IF batch conversion results are requested again within 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL return cached results to improve response time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to specify custom output formats for timestamp conversions, so that I can receive results in the exact format required by my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies a custom output format parameter THEN the system SHALL return timestamps in the requested format
2. WHEN no output format is specified THEN the system SHALL return timestamps in ISO 8601 format as default
3. WHEN an invalid format string is provided THEN the system SHALL return an error with supported format examples
4. WHEN multiple output formats are requested THEN the system SHALL return results in all specified formats
5. IF the output format includes timezone information THEN the system SHALL include the appropriate timezone offset

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to convert timestamps between different timezones, so that I can display times correctly for users in various geographical locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides IANA timezone identifiers THEN the system SHALL convert timestamps to the specified timezone
2. WHEN timezone conversion is requested THEN the system SHALL support all standard IANA timezone identifiers
3. WHEN an invalid timezone identifier is provided THEN the system SHALL return an error with suggested valid timezones
4. WHEN timezone conversion includes daylight saving time transitions THEN the system SHALL handle the conversion accurately
5. IF no target timezone is specified THEN the system SHALL assume UTC as the target timezone

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want quick access to commonly used timezones, so that I can efficiently convert timestamps without needing to remember complex timezone identifiers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests available timezones THEN the system SHALL return a list of commonly used timezone identifiers grouped by region
2. WHEN timezone shortcuts are used (e.g., "EST", "PST") THEN the system SHALL map them to appropriate IANA identifiers
3. WHEN timezone information is requested THEN the system SHALL include current offset and DST status
4. WHEN timezone conversion is performed THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for timezone differences
5. IF timezone data is outdated THEN the system SHALL update timezone information automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want the API to handle high traffic efficiently, so that my application remains responsive even during peak usage periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests exceed 100 requests per minute per IP THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting with appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 with retry-after headers
3. WHEN authenticated users make requests THEN the system SHALL provide higher rate limits based on their tier
4. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN the system SHALL log rate limit violations for monitoring
5. IF rate limiting affects legitimate usage THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for rate limit increases

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want fast response times for repeated requests, so that my application performs efficiently without unnecessary processing delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identical conversion requests are made within 10 minutes THEN the system SHALL return cached results
2. WHEN cache is used THEN the system SHALL include cache status headers in the response
3. WHEN cached data expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the cache with new calculations
4. WHEN cache storage reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL use LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
5. IF cache becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue processing requests without caching

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor API performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including request context
2. WHEN errors are returned to users THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and alerts
4. WHEN API usage patterns change THEN the system SHALL log usage statistics for analysis
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts to administrators

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to visualize timezone differences, so that I can better understand the time relationships between different regions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timezone conversion results are returned THEN the system SHALL include timezone offset information
2. WHEN multiple timezones are compared THEN the system SHALL provide relative time difference data
3. WHEN timezone visualization is requested THEN the system SHALL return data suitable for creating timezone comparison charts
4. WHEN daylight saving time affects conversions THEN the system SHALL indicate DST status in the response
5. IF timezone data includes historical information THEN the system SHALL provide access to past timezone rules
