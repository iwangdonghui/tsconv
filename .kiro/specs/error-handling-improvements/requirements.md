# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the error handling experience in the timestamp converter application. Currently, users may encounter unclear error messages or lack immediate feedback when entering invalid input. This enhancement will provide better user experience through friendly error messages, real-time validation feedback, and helpful recovery suggestions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear and helpful error messages when I enter invalid input, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters invalid timestamp input THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message explaining the issue
2. WHEN a user enters invalid date input THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message indicating the expected format
3. WHEN a system error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a generic friendly message without exposing technical details
4. WHEN an error message is displayed THEN it SHALL include actionable guidance on how to resolve the issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive immediate feedback while typing, so that I can correct mistakes before submitting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the input field THEN the system SHALL validate the input in real-time
2. WHEN invalid input is detected THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators (red border, warning icon)
3. WHEN valid input is detected THEN the system SHALL show positive visual indicators (green border, check icon)
4. WHEN input is partially valid THEN the system SHALL show neutral indicators and helpful hints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see suggestions for fixing errors, so that I can quickly resolve issues and continue using the tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid timestamp format is entered THEN the system SHALL suggest valid timestamp formats
2. WHEN an out-of-range date is entered THEN the system SHALL suggest valid date ranges
3. WHEN a common mistake is detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific correction suggestions
4. WHEN multiple input formats are possible THEN the system SHALL show examples of accepted formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the error handling to work consistently across all input methods, so that I have a predictable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using manual date input THEN error handling SHALL follow the same patterns as timestamp input
2. WHEN using the current time feature THEN any errors SHALL be handled gracefully
3. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN error states SHALL be properly managed
4. WHEN switching between input modes THEN error states SHALL be cleared appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want error messages to be accessible, so that I can use the tool with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the error message SHALL be announced to screen readers
2. WHEN error states change THEN the changes SHALL be communicated to assistive technologies
3. WHEN error messages are displayed THEN they SHALL have proper ARIA attributes
4. WHEN focusing on invalid inputs THEN screen readers SHALL announce the error information
