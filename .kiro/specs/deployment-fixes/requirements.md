# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses TypeScript compilation errors that prevent successful
deployment to Vercel. The errors indicate missing module declarations and import
path issues that need to be resolved to ensure the application builds correctly
in the deployment environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build successfully on
Vercel, so that I can deploy updates without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs on Vercel THEN all TypeScript files SHALL compile
   without "Cannot find module" errors
2. WHEN importing modules from relative paths THEN the TypeScript compiler SHALL
   resolve all module references correctly
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the deployment SHALL proceed without TypeScript
   compilation failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API handlers to have their
dependencies properly resolved, so that the application functions correctly in
production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API handlers import utility modules THEN all imports SHALL resolve to
   existing files
2. WHEN API handlers import service modules THEN all service dependencies SHALL
   be available
3. WHEN API handlers import middleware modules THEN all middleware dependencies
   SHALL be properly linked

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript configuration to be
consistent across development and deployment environments, so that builds are
predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building locally THEN the same TypeScript errors that appear in
   deployment SHALL be visible
2. WHEN TypeScript configuration is updated THEN both environments SHALL use the
   same compilation settings
3. WHEN module resolution occurs THEN the same paths SHALL work in both
   development and production

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing files to be identified and
created, so that all import statements can be resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module is imported but doesn't exist THEN the missing file SHALL be
   identified
2. WHEN missing files are created THEN they SHALL export the expected interfaces
   and functions
3. WHEN all missing files are resolved THEN the build SHALL complete
   successfully
